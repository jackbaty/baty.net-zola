We're back on Hugo for baty.net.

For the past few months, I've been learning how to create a blog using [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com) and it's been a blast. Kirby is pleasant, easy, and fun to use. I'm glad I did it.

I won't bother you with a 2,000-word rationalization piece about switching. I just felt like using Hugo again, so here we are.

I missed my nice Emacs-based publishing workflow. I missed "normal" YAML front matter. I missed having a completely static website. Who knows where we'll be in a month, but today we're using Hugo. I went back to the PaperMod theme. I don't love how boring it is, but it's clean, feature-rich, frequently updated, and easy to customize.

People make fun of me for switching platforms so often. That's fine. It's what I do. I like to play with blogs and blogging tools.
