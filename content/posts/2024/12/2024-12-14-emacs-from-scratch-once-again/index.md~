I went to bed last night all fired up about the idea of rebuilding my Emacs configuration from scratch. I've been happily using [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) for some time, but missed the feeling of having built something myself. I mean, if I wanted everything done for me, I could just use Obsidian, right?
