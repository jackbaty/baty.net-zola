Yesterday, I had three "pods" on [PikaPods]( https://www.pikapods.com): [Ghost](https://ghost.org), [Actual Budget](https://actualbudget.org), and [Linkding](https://linkding.link). Today, I have none.

Deleting Ghost was easy, since I moved back to Hugo. 

I wasn't using Actual Budget enough, so losing that isn't a sacrifice. 

Linkding I really like, but for weeks I'd add links to it, then never go back to look at any of them. There are other, simpler ways to manage bookmarks. Same goes for a "read later" service. I still grab the markdown, create a PDF and print it. If it's not worth doing that, I'm probably not going to bother reading it later, anyway.

PikaPods is a great way to spin up inexpensive (mostly) self-hosted web apps. I just didn't need the ones I was using.
