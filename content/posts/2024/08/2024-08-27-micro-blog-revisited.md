It's been a couple weeks since moving my blog back to Hugo and, surprisingly, I'm perfectly happy with it. However, I'm not as sure about these daily notes posts.

I often manually crosspost from here to Mastodon, and wonder if maybe I'd prefer having that happen automatically. That won't work if I continue using the current format, so I've been thinking about splitting short posts off again to a separate (micro) blog. 

[daily.baty.net](https://daily.baty.net) would be fine for this, but this time around I'm in a less-software mood, so I'd prefer not having to fire up Tinderbox right now. Plus, I want posting to be dead simple.

I considered using [Scribbles](https://scribbles.page) since I already have [a blog there](https://scribbles.baty.net). It could easily be used for the daily posts, and I've already paid for a lifetime subscription. As good as Scribbles is, it just doesn't fit my sensibilities, somehow, so I'm going to let that one idle for now.

Enter [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog). I canceled my Micro.blog subscription a while ago, after using it since the original Kickstarter. No reason, I just wanted to try something else, probably.

While reviewing what I wanted from a daily microblog, I realized that Micro.blog hits just about every point. So, I renewed my subscription, switched to the Tiny theme with a couple of tweaks, set up crossposting, and I'm off and running again at [jack.micro.blog](https://jack.micro.blog).

This is an experiment. Specifics may change without notice üòÅ.
