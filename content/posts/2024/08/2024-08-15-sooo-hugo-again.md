Remember that time (last year) when I was still using Hugo for baty.net? Well, it's back.

Kirby CMS is great, and has been a blast to learn, but I'm kind of in a static-site mood right now.

The old site's repo was still on Github, so I cloned it, updated things, installed the latest PaperMod theme, and here we are.
