I've been trying to hang on to using DuckDuckGo as my default search engine, but the DDG results have become less and less useful for some reason, so I frequently head over to use Google search. Which, blech.

I've been back to using Safari as my default browser, so I installed the new ["Lucky" extension](https://andadinosaur.com/launch-lucky) from And a Dinosaur. I don't really understand how it works yet, but here's what the search results look like:

That's pretty refreshing, no? Also, I'll take paginated results over infinite scrolling any day.
