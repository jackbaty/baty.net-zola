I may have solved at least some of my problems caused by taking notes too many different apps. I moved all of them into ~/Documents/Notes, with subfolders per app. So...

```
├── Denote
├── Howm
├── Obsidian
└── SilverBullet
```

You'll notice [SilverBullet](https://silverbullet.md) in there, my newest infatuation. But here's the trick, I just point the default target for [HoudahSpot](https://www.houdah.com/houdahSpot/) searches at the enclosing Notes/ folder, and I can find most anything right away.

You'll note that this means I am restricted to apps that allow me to configure where notes are kept and that they're kept in some form of plain text. That covers most of my tools. I had been using DEVONthink for this, but it's been giving me trouble lately so I'm looking at simpler options. I'm digging it.
