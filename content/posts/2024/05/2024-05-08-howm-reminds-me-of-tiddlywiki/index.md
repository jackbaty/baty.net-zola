Something I've always liked about [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com) is that I'm never forced to decide where something goes or what it's named. I can simply click on the new tiddler button, type something, and hit save. Links, tags, or other organization can be applied later, but none are required.

The [Howm](https://kaorahi.github.io/howm/) Emacs package works similarly. By default, Howm[^case] notes are organized in YYYY/MM/ folders and file names are automatically created based on the current time, e.g. 2024-05-07-130712.txt. I don't have to think about them. 

It's nice to just make a new note and not care where it goes. I sometimes get twitchy about not having useful file names. "What about accessing your notes outside Howm?" First, I never do that. Second, there's grep, Spotlight, or any other text editor that can search a folder full of plain text files. This is not something I need worry about. In fact, it's slightly better than with TiddlyWiki, since to find something in TiddlyWiki, I need a web browser to open the wiki and search. There's only one useful way in. Of course that's never a problem, but still.

This is fine:

I continue to be surprised by how quickly Howm has become an important part of my workflow. I should write about how the combination of Howm and Denote fit into my process.


[^case]: I've decided to write it as "Howm" with an initial capital. Howm is an acronym, but I've never seen it capitalized as "HOWM". I don't like it all lowercase, since it feels like it should be treated as a proper noun, so I'm going with "Howm".
