There are times I don't feel like blogging the hard way[^hard]. When that happens, I look to simple, hosted, CMS-based blogging tools. 

Recently, I've been experimenting with [Pika](https://pika.page) and [Scribbles](https://scribbles.page). I like both of them. They are both simple, clean, easy, and inexpensive. Choosing either of them for a blog would be fine.

There is one thing that concerns me a little, and that is the hobby nature of these tools. I don't mean to be dismissive by calling them "hobbies", but I can't help but feel that these kinds of tools are always at risk of being abandoned when their authors' attention shifts to something new.

This is one reason I no longer use any of [Dave Winer](https://scripting.com)'s stuff, no matter how clever. They tend to [just go away](http://fargo.io/). 

One exception I know of is [Blot.im](https://blot.im). I've been [using Blot](https://baty.blog) on and off since 2017. David still updates it regularly and still answers emails quickly whenever there's an issue.

The [Lindy effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect) applies here, and is worth thinking about when considering new tools.

I'm happy to support these efforts. I subscribe to Blot and have paid for a lifetime subscription to Scribbles. I'm still evaluating Pika. The decision about whether to actually commit to them for my blog is more difficult.



[^hard]: By "hard" I mean having to do everything myself, like with Kirby, Hugo, Tinderbox, etc.
