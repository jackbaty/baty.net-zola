My life would be simpler if I could convince myself to stop worrying about things like[^list]:

- How should I rename photos during import?
- What if the app goes away?
- How will I find this later?
- Are my notes are in the right app or format?
- What if I switch to Linux?
- Are file names consistent everywhere?
- Kebab case or Camel case?
- Has anyone at the company done anything problematic recently?
- What will people think of me if I start/stop using this app?
- Will this be readable in 100 years?

Almost none of these are truly important, even though they all seem very important at the time.

[^list]: This is a very incomplete list
