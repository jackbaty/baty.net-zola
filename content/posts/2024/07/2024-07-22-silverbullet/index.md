Today I learned about [SilverBullet](https://silverbullet.md/)

{{< figure src="silver-bullet-100x-crop.png" align="center" >}}

> SilverBullet is a note-taking application optimized for people with a [hacker mindset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker). We all take notes. There’s a million note taking applications out there. [Literally](https://www.noteapps.ca/). Wouldn’t it be nice to have one where your notes are _more_than plain text files? Where your notes essentially become a _database_ that you can query; that you can build custom knowledge applications on top of? A _hackable notebook_, if you will?

Well now who can't resist that? Me, that's who.

I installed SilverBullet via [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/), which is also new to me, and is delicious. 

First impressions are (it's only been a few hours) that I think he's onto something. I can't explain it, but SilverBullet immediately felt more _right_ to me than Obsidian. I am running it locally on my Mac Mini and accessing it from everywhere else using Tailscale.

I certainly don't need another way to take notes, but I'm going to continue giving SilverBullet a spin and see if it leads anywhere.
