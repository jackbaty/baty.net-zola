I'm finding it difficult being "off" social media right now. Every time there's a lull in my thoughts, I want to reach for one of my feeds. It's how I avoid doing anything useful.

I want social media to be a source of information and not purely entertainment, but it usually ends up being entertainment. Also, it's often infuriating, which is why I stepped away in the first place.

One thing I've noticed is that when I'm not sharing things, I feel kind of invisible. I _like_ sharing things. My blog(s) are good for sharing. It's what they're for. But not having comments on the blogs means there's not much actual engagement. I like engagement :). That's what Mastodon (and more recently, Micro.blog) is good at, which is why I find it difficult to leave.

What I'd like to do is to continue posting to my social media accounts, but stop reading the feeds. Is that rude? It feels rude. Is it reasonable and acceptible to post things to social media without being "on" social media? Is it even possible?
