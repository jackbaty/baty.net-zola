[Tinderbox](https://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/) is an unusual, powerful, quirky, and amazing piece of software. I don't understand why more people don't use it for everything. Maybe because it costs $298 and that's expensive by today's app store race-to-the-bottom pricing situation. It's worth every penny, though.

Before Emacs came along, I put _everything_ into Tinderbox. These days, I use Tinderbox for specific projects that benefit from its unique features. I also maintain my blog at [daily.baty.net](https://daily.baty.net/) with it.

The blog's Tinderbox document is an outline organized by year/month/day/note. It contains all the HTML/CSS for rendering the site. It contains scripts for grabbing the daily weather forecast and for publishing and deploying the site. It's kind of crazy when you think about it.

It looks like this.
