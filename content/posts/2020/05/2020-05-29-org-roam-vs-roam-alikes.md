As you probably know, I struggle with [where to keep my notes](https://www.copingmechanism.com/2020/take-lots-of-notes-thinsp-mdash-thinsp-but-where). For a few months now it's been a battle between [Org-roam](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam) and [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/). Org-roam has been in the lead, mostly due to Roam being unstable and (soon to be) expensive. Also, my infatuation with Org mode is on again.

Using Emacs takes work on my part. It takes mental energy. I'm nearly always OK with that, because Emacs has Org mode and Org mode beats everything at what it does. On the other hand, sometimes I'm lazy or tired. I just want to lean back and point-and-click my way around. That's not how Emacs works. I wrote earlier that, "Getting to a link I have stored in Org-roam takes me about five seconds longer than the same link in Roam." In other words, Emacs with Org mode (and by extension, Org-roam) is better, but it's a lot _harder_.

Yesterday, I tried the Roam-alike, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). Obsidian could be, for me, a viable replacement for Roam. It looks good, has all the necessary features, uses local storage only (by default), and is based on Markdown. I played with it for only a couple hours, but I really liked it. It's easy! Well, crap. Now what?

I took a breath and thought about it. Honestly, Obsidian shifted the battle lines. Now, it's Org-roam vs Obsidian. I can live without block-level transclusion and queries in Roam. I can, reluctantly, live without an outliner. I can certainly live without founders I'm uncomfortable with.

But, I don't think I can live without Org mode. My ~/org directory has _everything_. It's not just my notes repository. It's my Journal, my todo list, my authoring environment, my reference manager, my time tracker, my PDF viewer/annotator, and sometimes my email and RSS client. I love the idea that I can `ripgrep` in ~/org and find anything. I love that everything always behaves the same way (bindings, editing, file handling, etc.). I love that it's all local and free and is more likely than any of the alternatives to be around for decades.

Yes, Emacs can be difficult and frustrating. It is a tweaker's dream and at the same time can be a nightmare for someone trying to just be productive. This is crazy-making if you're both of those people.

So right now, Roam and the other Roam-alikes will have to sit on the sidelines. I'm writing this on Friday, May 29, 2020. Just making a note.
