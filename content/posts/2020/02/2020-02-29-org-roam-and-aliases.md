I just learned that [Org-roam](https://github.com/jethrokuan/org-roam) supports aliases. This means that I can reference pages in my Org-roam database in more than one way. 

For example, I might want to have a page for "World War II" but when mentioning it I would just use "WWII". It's done like this...


    
    #+TITLE: World War II #+ROAM_ALIAS: "WWII" "World War 2" 

This is really handy. Even "real" [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) doesn't support this as easily yet.

It's [in the docs](https://org-roam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/anatomy/). I should read them more often.
