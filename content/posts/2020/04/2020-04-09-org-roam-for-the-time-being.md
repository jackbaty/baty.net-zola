title: I'll be using Org-roam for the time being

It's been a challenging week for me using [Roam](https://roamresearch.com). For
the past several days my Roam database simply wouldn't load. I'd see the
spinning Astrolabe forever. Deleting the site data in my browser and restarting
would help for a time, but then it would happen again.

What I've come to learn is that I _need_ my Roam database available to me all
the time. I understand that Roam is still in beta, but here we are.

While I wait for Roam to figure things out, I'm back to using
[Org-roam](https://github.com/jethrokuan/org-roam). This means that I'm
dependent upon Emacs for useful notes, and I was trying to avoid that, but at least I can get at my notes were
something to break. You know, text files and all that.

I prefer "real" Roam, but Org-roam is pretty great, and is improving so fast it's
hard to keep up with it. Of course Org mode is just so good anyway. Oh, and it's
stable, so it's got that going for it.
