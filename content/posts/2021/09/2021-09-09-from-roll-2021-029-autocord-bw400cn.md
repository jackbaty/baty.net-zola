My [1962 Minolta Autocord][1] has seen better days.

I had an expired (in 2006) roll of Kodak BW400CN (C-41) film in 120 so I figured I didn&#8217;t have much to lose. The film looks ok, but the camera scratched the hell out of it on the way through. And the frame spacing was all over the place, including a couple of frames with _no_ space between them.

The old Autocord was fun to shoot, but I think it&#8217;s time for it to retire. It looks cool on the shelf, so that&#8217;s something.
