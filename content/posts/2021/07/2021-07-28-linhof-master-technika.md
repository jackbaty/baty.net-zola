Anyone who&#8217;s dabbled in large format photography knows the name &#8220;Linhof&#8221;. It&#8217;s one of those companies with a long history and a reputation for building some of the best 4&#215;5 field cameras available. I&#8217;ve always been curious about them. Are they really &#8220;the Leica of large format&#8221;?

My first 4&#215;5 camera was a beat up Burke & James press camera. Then a beat up Crown Graphic. Then a Speed Graphic, and finally a Wista Field Camera. The first three were super cheap. The Wista was bit more serious, but it was such a beautiful wooden camera.

The problem I have with large format is that I hate tripods. I had the most fun shooting the Speed Graphic hand-held. This is not how large format is done today, though. Maybe back when Weegee was doing his thing, but now it&#8217;s for sharp and super-detailed landscape and architectural work, mostly. Maybe studio portraits. Nonsense, I want to do hand-held, informal, environmental portraits. My Speed Graphic has a light leak, though, so I haven&#8217;t been shooting much 4&#215;5.

Then one afternoon I spotted a Linhof Master Technika kit in one of the forum classified sections. It was the camera, lenses, grip, viewfinder, cams, and film holders. The camera was recently CLA&#8217;d and had the bellows replaced with genuine Linhof replacement bellows. Basically, it was everything I&#8217;d need for handheld 4&#215;5 work. Plus, it was the mythical Linhof.

I bought it. The gentleman who sold it to me included a stack of large format photograph books, negative sleeves, a cool Grafmatic film holder and a bunch of hand-written notes with details about many of the items. I couldn&#8217;t be happier with the purchase.

And the camera? It was made in 1972 but looks and feels almost new. The short version is that it&#8217;s as well-built and smooth as I&#8217;ve been told. Everything is solid and tight and moves like butter. Its build quality feels so far beyond that of my old Graphics that it&#8217;s hardly fair to compare them.

It came with three lenses: A 90mm Schneider-Kreuznach Super-Angulon f/8, A 135mm Rodenstock APO-Sironar-S f/5.6, and a 240mm Fujinon A f/9. All three lenses have lens-specific custom cams that allow for accurate focusing using the rangefinder. This means I can focus and shoot hand-held with any of them. And just look at that giant grip!

I&#8217;ve only had the camera for a week, and shot maybe a dozen sheets so far. It&#8217;s a joy to use, and I hope to use it often. Here are a few photos I&#8217;ve made while getting used to using the camera.
