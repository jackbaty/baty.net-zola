<!--kg-card-begin: html-->My last house had a proper darkroom. It was a little janky, but there was a big sink, room for three enlargers, a wet side, a dry side, etc.

When I moved into my new house, I originally planned to turn an extra room in the basement into a shiny new darkroom. That didn&#8217;t happen, so I&#8217;ve been using the bathroom instead. It works fine.

Here&#8217;s my fancy darkroom.

The worst part of the whole thing is that tiny faucet. At minimum I should put in a tall one. As it is now, I need to fill a 1qt measuring cup, and then use that to fill containers. It&#8217;s a pain. The HomePod is nice because I can just tell it what to play in the dark.

I don&#8217;t have a fitting for the faucet to run a hose into the washing tray, so I just let the faucet pour into it.

I ran some string across the shower to use as a hanger for drying prints and film. Works great.

Here&#8217;s the meat of the operation. This is the bathroom closet, converted into the &#8220;dry side&#8221;. There&#8217;s room for this Leitz Focomat V35 enlarger. The V35 is a fantastic piece of equipment, but only enlarges 35mm film. I&#8217;m considering something that can do medium format as well. I have two 4&#215;5 enlargers in storage but there is no way they&#8217;d fit. I can, however, make 4&#215;5&#8243; contact prints on 5&#215;7&#8243; paper. I love making those, so that should do.

There&#8217;s room for all sorts of photo paper and chemicals. I&#8217;ve only been making enlargements up to 8&#215;10&#8243; so some of this is no longer needed but I can&#8217;t bring myself to get rid of it. I also store my film scanner here.

Anyway, that&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s my darkroom. I was planning to _not_ shoot any film in 2021 but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;ll stick, so I dusted everything off and mixed up a fresh batch of chemicals in preparation for spending more time here.
