I&#8217;ve been asking myself, &#8220;[Who[sic] should I let manage my photos?][1]&#8221; as a way to talk myself into letting Lightroom and the Adobe ecosystem take over the nitty gritty of file and library management. In the end, I couldn&#8217;t go through with it, so I remain in charge.

Yes, it can be a pain to deal with files, folders, storage, backups, naming, and so on. But, managing things myself is the way I&#8217;ve always done it. One of the most important things I &#8220;own&#8221; are my photos. Why would I give up _any_ control over them? For now, at least, I&#8217;m not going to. I&#8217;m back to my process of culling, naming, tagging, and cataloging with Photo Mechanic Plus and editing in Capture One Pro.

So, 2021, here we come!
