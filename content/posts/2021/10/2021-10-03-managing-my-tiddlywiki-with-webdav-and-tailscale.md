Short version: I am managing [my TiddlyWiki wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.wiki/)s as stand-alone HTML documents using a [WebDAV server](https://www.schimera.com/products/webdav-nav-server/) accessed securely from anywhere via [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) and I can now drag and drop images into content and have them uploaded and linked automatically. It's brilliant!

As much as I love TiddlyWiki, I've never enjoyed managing images with it. Embedded images are easiest but can quickly bulk up the wiki's HTML file size, so I reference them instead. I've done this a couple ways.

The cheat version is to just use the embed code of an image I've previously uploaded to [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jbaty/). The second best option is to put the images in a /files directory within the same directory as the wiki itself and reference it using something like `[img[files/my-image-file.png]]`.

It's not _hard_ to do, but having to move each image to my wiki/files directory, then hand-write the path/filename to create a link adds just enough friction to prevent me from using images as freely as I might otherwise.

[TiddlyWiki 5.2.0](https://tiddlywiki.com/#Release%205.2.0) was released recently, and it includes a great new feature that lets me drag and drop an image into an open "tiddler" which is then embedded and linked automatically. This is a terrific improvement, but it still embeds the image within the wiki file, which I was hoping to avoid.

Enter the [File Uploads plugin](https://saqimtiaz.github.io/tw5-file-uploads/) from [Saq Imtiaz](https://twitter.com/saqimtiaz) and with it a brand-new PUT option for WebDAV.

This is all pretty new to me, so I'm probably not qualified to write a full-on tutorial, but here's what I did...

Upgraded my wiki to 5.2.0. ([https://tiddlywiki.com/upgrade.html](https://tiddlywiki.com/upgrade.html))

Installed the [File Uploads plugin](https://saqimtiaz.github.io/tw5-file-uploads/) and the accompanying PUT plugin via simple drag and drop into my wiki file (TiddlyWiki is cool that way).

![Configuring the File Uploads plugin](/img/2021/20211003-uploads.png)

Configured the plugin by telling it to use the "PUT" uploader and where I'd like uploads to go (relative to the wiki file itself). I chose "files/2021".
