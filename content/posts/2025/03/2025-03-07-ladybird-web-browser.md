[Ladybird](https://ladybird.org/):

> Ladybird is a brand-new browser & web engine. Driven by a web standards first approach, Ladybird aims to render the modern web with good performance, stability and security.
>
> From its humble beginnings as an HTML viewer for the SerenityOS hobby operating system project, Ladybird has since grown into a cross-platform browser supporting Linux, macOS, and other Unix-like systems.
>
> Ladybird is currently in heavy development. We are targeting a first Alpha release for early adopters in 2026.

Something to keep an eye on.
