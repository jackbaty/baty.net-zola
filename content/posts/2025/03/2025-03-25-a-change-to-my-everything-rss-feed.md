For a while, I tried maintaining a combined RSS feed that included posts from all my sundry blogs. I kept it at /everything.rss. It was managed as part of my WordPress blog, and since I've stopped using WordPress, I've been redirecting /everything.rss to the feed for baty.net, which is either /feed or /index.xml, depending on my blog platform of the day.

I think that instead of that, I'll piggyback off my [@batybot](https://mastodon.social/@batybot/) account on Mastodon.social. I crosspost most stuff from my sites to @batybot via [EchoFeed](https://echofeed.app/) already, and Mastodon offers an rss feed for each account. Mine is [https://mastodon.social/@batybot.rss](https://mastodon.social/@batybot.rss). 

Soon, I'll redirect requests from baty.net/everything.rss to [https://mastodon.social/@batybot.rss](https://mastodon.social/@batybot.rss). This doesn't offer full posts, but rather it's more like a firehose of links to everything I post. If you'd like to avoid that kind of noise, delete your subscription to /everything.rss. If you are a glutton for punishment, feel free to subscribe.
