I've migrated [daily.baty.net](https://daily.baty.net) to Kirby CMS. It has been a static site managed by [Tinderbox](https://eastgate.com/Tinderbox) for a long time. I love Tinderbox, but now that baty.net is back on Hugo, I wanted a playground for learning more about Kirby, without moving the main blog back and forth between Hugo and Kirby. So, here we are.

Your RSS feed is probably complaining right now. Sorry about that.
