A week or so ago, I installed [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org) on my old ThinkPad, and we hit it off immediately. I've tried various Linux distributions before, but nothing stuck. Omarchy is very sticky.

Tiling window managers have always fascinated me. I tried i3 for a while, but using it on the little laptop screen felt limiting, somehow. I never really got on with them. For some reason, [Hyprland](https://hypr.land/) is different. At least whatever they've done to configure it by default in Omarchy feels different. It made sense right away. 

I got along with Omarchy so well that I wanted to try it "for real", meaning on a desktop machine with a big monitor. I have a beautiful and expensive Apple Studio Display, so whatever I use needs to work with that. I'll document the details somewhere, later, but I ended up with a Beelink mini-pc ([this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKNMV258)) and a [weird DisplayPort -> USB cable](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BNX7MS6N). For $500 I got a Mac Mini look-alike with a fast (enough) processor, 32GB of memory, and a 1TB SSD. A similarly-spec'd Mac Mini would run around $1,300. I'm sure the M4 Mini is faster, but that's a lot of extra money. I'm happy to report that it works great with the Studio Display.

So now I'm sitting here at my desk, doing nearly everything[^1] on the little Beelink running Omarchy.

But there's a problem. I've been using an M2 Mac Mini as a home server for a while. I've installed [nomachine](https://nomachine.com) on that and the Beelink so I can remotely control the Mac. This works pretty well, and got me thinking: Since I'm only doing a few things on the Mac now, why not just use the Mini for those things, as well as using it as a server? I could install Lightroom etc. on it and control it remotely when I need it? If it's too laggy, I could figure out how to use a KVM switch instead.

But then, what about that M4 MacBook Air I just bough a couple months ago? What about my external drives (formatted for Mac)? What about backups? I'm using Firefox?

You see how everything has been upended?

I've been using a Mac since the 1980s. My entire computing world view is based on macOS. This is weird, but it's kind of amazing how much fun I'm having.





[^1]: Photo editing and film scanning/conversions rely on Lightroom Classic, so I'm not off macOS completely. And I miss Facetime and Messages, a lot.
