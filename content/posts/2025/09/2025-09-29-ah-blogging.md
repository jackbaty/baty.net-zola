You may or may not have noticed that I've been posting over at my experimental WordPress blog at [baty.blog](https://baty.blog). I wish I had a good explanation for it, but I don't. It may be that my current foray into using Linux has caused a bit of keyboard-and-text-only fatigue. I mean, it's been all day in a terminal or TUI or NeoVim for everything. I have been dealing with sync and config and updates and so on. By the time I go to write something on the blog, I've lost the mood, so I've been clicking "New Post" in my browser, typing a bit, dragging and dropping an image or two, and clicking the Publish button. It's kind of a relief, honestly.

I still dream of [having only one blog](https://baty.net/posts/2025/09/how-to-have-only-one-blog/), but until I stop being so moody about it, that feels unlikely. I started this post just to see if I was back in the mood for Emacs/Hugo. I apologize for my continued tendencies to jump all over the place. I know it's annoying. In the meantime, I'm writing mostly here, or over at [baty.blog](https://baty.blog), or on [the wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.org).
