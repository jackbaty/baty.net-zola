I've dipped my toes into using Linux a few times in recent years, but it never stuck. When I saw a demo of [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org), it made me want to try again. Omarchy made me decide to finally learn whether I could actually use Linux in anger, on a desktop. So I bought a desktop. See [It's all upside-down (computer-wise)](https://baty.net/posts/2025/09/its-all-upside-down-computer-wise/).

After a few days, the answer to "can I use Linux for real?" was "Yes!", so I started side-eyeing my M4 MacBook Air, thinking I could replace it with a Linux laptop. So I did. I ordered a new [Framework 13 laptop](https://frame.work/laptop13). The Framework arrives this week, and I couldn't be more excited. In fact, this whole escapade may have been a not-so-well disguised plan to trick myself into buying one of those cool laptops.

It's possible that I've gotten ahead of myself here, but what a fun ride so far.
