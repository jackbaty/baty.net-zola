Remember that time I was trying Linux "for real" and even created a blog to write about it? It was more an excuse to play with the clever [BSSG](https://bssg.dragas.net) blogging engine, but still.

Well, I'm doing it again. This time with Omarchy, so I dusted off the BSSG blog and pushed a quick update. [But, but, Omarchy! | Jack Tries Linux](https://linux.baty.net/2025/09/but-omarchy/).

Don't expect much. This usually lasts about 3 days before fizzling out, but it's always a fun-but-frustrating 3 days.
