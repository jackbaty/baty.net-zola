I've been blogging since 2000. I've written thousands of posts, mostly about only a handful of things. Honestly, I'm a little bored with all of it. The thought of writing even more of the same things about the same things is exhausting.

The world seems to become more awful every day. I am increasingly uninterested in the incessant and unavoidable discourse and meta-discourse around AI. What does it say about me that I don't feel like writing about one of the most disruptive and contentious technologies to come along in decades?

Should I write about Apple? JFC don't we have more than enough of that, already? (Answer: We do).

How about I  talk about my latest blogging platform change. Yeah, that's fun. Do more of that. ðŸ™„

One thing feels certain, my mood is changing. I have decreasing motivation for writing full-on Blog Posts about _anything_ lately. I don't have the energy.

I may still have the energy to continue to narrate my day as I go, but I don't know the best way to do that. Daily posts here on the blog feel weird for some reason. I think this is why I dusted off the [daily.baty.net](https://daily.baty.net) blog yesterday. It's better suited to a more stream-of-conciousness approach.
