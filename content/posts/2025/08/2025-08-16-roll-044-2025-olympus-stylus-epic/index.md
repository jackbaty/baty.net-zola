A roll of HP5 through the Stylus Epic. I love that little camera, but taping up the seam to avoid light leaks is no longer working. It'll be sad if I have to retire the camera.

The cover photo here is the kind of photo I love. It's just slightly off, somehow. It causes the viewer to stop and think, "Wait, what's going on here?" for just a moment. That's what it does for me, anyway.
