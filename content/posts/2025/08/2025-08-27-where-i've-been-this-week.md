In case you're wondering, I've been posting over on [the wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.org) and [daily.baty.net](https://daily.baty.net) this week. I was in the mood for a change of venue. Also, I kind of got spooked by a small surge in traffic here. For someone who posts in public every day, I still don't like being watched. So, I write in places that fewer people know or care about. It's weird, I know.
