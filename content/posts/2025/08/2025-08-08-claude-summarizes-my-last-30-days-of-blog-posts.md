Here's what Claude says about my recent posts:

I'll help you summarize your recent blog posts. Let me search for posts in the Blog/posts container that have been modified in the last 30 days.I see the Blog/posts container is organized by year, but these are just the year containers themselves. Let me look specifically at the 2025 posts since that's where your most recent content would be, and get the actual blog post content

Based on your blog posts from the last 30 days, here's a summary of what you've been writing about:

## Key Themes in Your Recent Writing

**Software and Tools Decision Fatigue**
You're clearly experiencing significant tension between different tools and platforms. This is your most prominent theme, appearing in posts about:
- Moving between Emacs, Tinderbox, and other tools for note-taking and journaling
- Email client struggles (particularly with Notmuch and various Mac email apps)
- Blogging platform decisions between Hugo/Kirby/Tinderbox/Ghost across multiple sites (baty.net, daily.baty.net, baty.photo)
- The exhaustion of having "3 or 4 ways of doing everything" and constantly second-guessing decisions

**Tinderbox Appreciation**
Despite the tool-switching struggles, you consistently return to praising Tinderbox as:
- Your "longest-running favorite app"
- A "pointy-clicky graphical counterpart to Emacs"
- Making you "twitchy when you don't use it for too long"
- The perfect tool for this daily blog format

**Blogging Philosophy and Structure**
You've written thoughtfully about:
- Preferring the simplicity of this Tinderbox blog's "lack of necessary decisions"
- Wanting to consolidate to "One Blog" but currently maintaining 4 active sites
- The value of curation in an era of fragmented social media
- Preference for static sites over dynamic ones to reduce server maintenance anxiety

**Social Media and Digital Wellness**
Several posts touch on:
- Taking sabbaticals from social media due to amplification of "terrible shit"
- The health impacts of sitting at computers all day
- Finding the right amount of "friction" in digital tools
- Questioning LLM hand-wringing and asking for more nuanced discussion

**Creative and Technical Observations**
Shorter posts about:
- Music criticism (Blood Incantation's metal)
- Photography gear obsession vs. artistic vision
- Server migrations and technical deployments
- The importance of making notes "immediately useful" rather than just having them in plain text

The overall picture is of someone deeply thoughtful about their digital tools and workflows, but perhaps caught in analysis paralysis about the "right" way to do things. Your writing suggests both technical sophistication and a desire for simplicity that sometimes conflict with each other.

Yeah that's no hallucination.
