The Rolleiflex is new to me, so I have some learning and practice ahead of me. I took it on my usual route today and finished my second roll. I have to admit that I'm not thrilled with the results. Things look flat and a bit soft. It's like the lens is ghosting or flaring. Low contrast and not-quite-tack-sharp is not the look I'm going for.

The camera was easy and fun to carry and a pleasure to use, so it's got that going for it, at least. I'll give it a few rolls before I decide if I like what it gives me.
