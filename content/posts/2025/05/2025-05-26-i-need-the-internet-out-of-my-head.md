I've stopped being able to think for myself. I need you all to get out of my head for a minute.

I often joke that my entire personality is based on the latest YouTube video or blog post I've "consumed". It's funny, because it's true.

It feels as though everything in my brain has been influenced by something I watched or scrolled past in the last 8 hours. I never watch a movie without first reading the reviews on [Rotten Tomatoes](http://rottentomatoes.com/). I visit [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com/) before choosing a book to read.

Recently, I needed to replace a broken kitchen tool, so I went to Amazon to see what was "recommended". After twenty minutes reading reviews, I finally felt secure enough in my research that I ordered the goddamned spatula.

Social media is funny and fascinating. I learn so much from it and it can be wildly entertaining. Except that too much of the time it's telling me what I'm allowed to enjoy and what I need to condemn because reasons. I'm bombarded by hot takes and uninformed opinions about everything and everyone. I'm susceptible to those opinions and it's not good for me. You're not the boss of me, internet!

Part of my move to Ghost and ActivityPub in Ghost was an attempt to narrow the scope of my social media inputs.

Anyway, I'm going to spend some time outside or in a book or both. Maybe I'll take some photos or doodle in my notebook. Anything is better for me right now than piping The Scroll into my brain.
