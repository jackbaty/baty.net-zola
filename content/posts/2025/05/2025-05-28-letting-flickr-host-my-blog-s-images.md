[Flickr](https://flickr.com/) is still the best place to host and share images, I don't care what anyone else says.

After migrating content from Hugo to Ghost (and back again) this past week, I'm reminded of the mess I've made over the years. I'm leaning toward letting [Flickr host](https://flickr.com/photos/jbaty) my blog's images. 

You might be thinking, "But Jack, that's a third-party dependency! What if Flickr goes away?" Fair question, and one that has prevented me from going with Flickr on my blogs. For more than 20 years. And you know what? If I'd have been using Flickr all this time, I'd have 20 years of working links instead of the broken mess I've made by changing platforms and hosts and whatnot all the time.

Mike Hall made a [handy Raycast script](https://puddingtime.org/make-a-markdown-or-org-snippet-from-the-flickr-image-in-your-browser-raycast) for grabbing the image URL while visiting the photo page in a browser. It works a treat. I've tweaked it so that clipboard includes a link to the image so that folks can link through for the big version. (And who knows, maybe it'll inspire one or two of you to get back into Flickr, where we belong.)


The [Lindy Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect) is real and I may start taking advantage of it.

Note: The "featured image" in this post is coming from Flickr. If you can't see it, I was wrong :).
