summary: Putting the new Rolleiflex through its paces by subjecting it to some self-portraits of me

![Self-portrait](2025-Roll-215_09.jpg " ")

Whenever I don't feel there's anything interesting to photograph, I fall back on self portraits. I'm a willing subject, and who doesn't like looking at themselves? ðŸ˜†

I set up one Westcott strobe and my backdrop in a spare room/studio. The bulb release wouldn't work, but thankfully the Rolleiflex has a self timer.

These are from a roll of HP5, processed in HC-100(b) and scanned on the Epson.

I'm not sure that they give me the "Wow!" like the Hasselblad does, but they're not bad.
