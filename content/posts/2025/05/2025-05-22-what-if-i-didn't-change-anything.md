This week has been a whirlwind of blogging changes. Or, more accurately, a whirlwind of me _thinking_ about blogging changes.

I'm fascinated by the new ActivityPub features being built into Ghost. This would let me be part of the "Fediverse" without needing to belong to any specific instance of anything. I could blog and post to social media from the same place. People could follow me there, and I could follow them.

But I'm stuck. I had planned to leverage the copingmechanism.com domain for this, but I don't want to "live" at that domain. My domain is baty.net. My fediverse handle should be @jack@baty.net because that's the ideal option, right?

So, I started the process of moving baty.net to Ghost, but stopped when I remembered what a pain it is to migrate Hugo content to Ghost.

As I see it, I have three options:


1. Move baty.net to Ghost and import everything from Hugo
2. Move baty.net to Ghost and don’t bother importing anything
3. Don’t do anything. Keep Ghost at copingmechanism.com. This would be so easy.

The best option is #1. It's cleanest for everyone and doesn't break anything. Except it will break things. It always does.

I only have energy for #2. I hate to break all those links, though. I'd move the original blog to some other domain, but the links are still broken.

The conflict between 1 and 2 means I could end up choosing #3.

I’m catatonic over what to do here, so I haven’t done anything.
