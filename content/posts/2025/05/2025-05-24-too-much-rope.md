I had a couple of drinks last night and opened my laptop and accidentally launched Obsidian and thought, "Oh, I remember. This is pretty cool! I should use this for everything." so this morning I'm staring at Obsidian wondering what now?

But why not just bail on the Obsidian app and drop back into my beloved Emacs?

I've been asking myself that question all morning. Ostensibly, I simply felt like a change of venue this morning, and Obsidian seemed as good as any. But there's something larger lurking under the surface.

Playing with my Emacs config is a fun hobby. I do it all the time. Like, all the time. Every moment using Emacs can feel like, "...but this would be better if I made this one change..." where "one change" is a keyboard binding or a different package or a new theme or some little behavioral tweak using some homemade lisp.

I've recently broken some stuff that used to work. And do I really like the way my Org Agenda looks? Emacs gives me all the rope I need, which is great. For many, it's the perfect amount of rope. On days like today, though, it feels like too much rope.

I'm not planning to switch from Emacs to Obsidian. That would be silly. But I am taking a short break. A change of pace can be fun, and I'm in the mood for something fun and different. That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.
