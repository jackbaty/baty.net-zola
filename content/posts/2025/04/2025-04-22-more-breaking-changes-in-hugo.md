[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is actively developed and still gets a lot of attention. This is fine. What's not fine is that it seems like every third update introduces [breaking changes](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/13541).

I updated to 0.146.5 and my site failed to build. This was a theme thing, and thankfully the theme maintainer [was on it](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/issues/1719). Still annoying.

I like using Hugo and I like my theme and I like having a static website. What I don't like is not knowing if things are going to still work next week.

I don't want to migrate to something else...again...but I'm thinking about it.
