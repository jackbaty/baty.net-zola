I don’t mean to be rude, but I don’t care much what you think. OK, that’s not exactly true, **I care deeply what you think**. Maybe it’s more accurate to say that I don’t _worry_ about what you think. Are you mad that I keep switching platforms? Sorry, not sorry. Are you annoyed that I use words like “just” and “maybe” and “really” too often? Yeah, me too. We’ll get over it. Does it bother you that I don’t do enough throat-clearing before mentioning something that has become problematic? You’ll be fine. Would you prefer that I only write about Emacs? Not happening.

There, I feel a little better now, because when I got up this morning I wanted to apologize for being alive and just (see, there’s that word again) shut everything down. I don’t think I’ll do that, though, because regardless of what you think…_I think_…and it needs to come out somehow.
