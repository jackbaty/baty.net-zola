Since I'm [using only CLI and TUI apps in November](https://baty.net/posts/2025/10/cli-and-tui-only-for-november/), I needed to find a replacement for Mu4e in Emacs. As a long-time Mutt user, I assumed that's what I'd use. A couple people recommended that I try [aerc](https://aerc-mail.org/) instead.

I've run into aerc before, but assumed it was some super geeky thing meant for emailing software patches around. While it does do that, it handles "regular" email pretty well, too.

I'm only a few hours into it, so I'm not yet qualified to say if aerc is preferable to Mutt, but so far, so good. I've not done any significant customization, but I'm sure that will come later.

Thanks to [Christian Cleberg](https://cleberg.net/) for the nudge.
