> That’s not entirely fair. Wallace’s most famous book, Infinite Jest—1,079 pages and weighing 3.15 pounds (in the hardcover first edition)—is challenging. But Wallace wrote many other things, and some of them are quite accessible.

I hope that reading and talking about DFW makes a comeback. For a while there, Book Social Media was (rightfully) aligned against sound-smart lit-bros who wouldn’t shut up about Infinite Jest. I may have been one of them, because I loved (and still love) that book, so shut up.

But definitely read [This is Water](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5986375-this-is-water), even if it’s cliche by now. and [A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do Again](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6748.A_Supposedly_Fun_Thing_I_ll_Never_Do_Again) is a ton of fun. Oh, and his [piece about Federer](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/sports/playmagazine/20federer.html) is amazing, even if some of it might be exaggerated. Who cares?
