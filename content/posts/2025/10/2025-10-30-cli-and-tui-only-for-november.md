I think I'll try something. I think I'll try using only CLI and TUI apps during the month of November.

So this means:

- [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) / [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) instead of Emacs and Org-mode for notes
- [Mutt](https://mutt.org) instead of Mu4e for email
- [Taskwarrior](https://linkarzu.com/posts/neovim/markdown-setup-2025/) instead of Org-mode for tasks
- [LazyGit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) instead of Magit for Git.

I might even give [nb](https://xwmx.github.io/nb/#home) a fair shake, just for kicks.

Why would I bother with this? No reason other than that it's fun. Omarchy comes with a pretty complete LazyVim setup and I've been surprised by how nice it is.

Then I started tinkering with Taskwarrior and what a blast that is. I used it full-time for a couple years a long time ago. It's fun to revisit.

A tiling window manager with a bunch of terminal windows open feels like some kind of dashboard for super nerds and I want to play.
