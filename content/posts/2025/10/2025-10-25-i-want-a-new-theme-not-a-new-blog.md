Thing is, I prefer using an SSG for my blog, but I've been posting using WordPress over at [baty.blog](https://baty.blog) for a few reasons:

- I sometimes like a change of venue
- I like the Twenty Twenty Five theme
- It's nice having built-in comments and analytics
- If I _wanted_ to change themes, it's just a few clicks
- Dragging images into the editor is so easy
- Anything I might want to do is probably available as a plugin

But still, I would rather use an SSG like Hugo.

Instead of switching to WordPress, I think I would be OK if I had a new theme. Something with the following attributes:

- Full posts on home page, with the option to use `<!-- more -->` or whatever for extra-long posts.
- No dependency on featured images in order for it to look good. I'll add an image to the post if I want one.
- Need to pin the daily post each day.

Honestly, if I could find a theme that worked and looked like the Twenty Twenty Five theme but it was for, say, Jekyll, I'd consider switching to Jekyll. I just want to look at my blog and think, "Aah, that's nice". Currently, I don't.

I thought about firing up Claude Code and having it help me, but I really don't want to build and support my own theme.
