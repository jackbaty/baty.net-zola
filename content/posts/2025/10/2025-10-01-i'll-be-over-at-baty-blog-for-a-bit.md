I'm bored with baty.net right now. I need a break from the SSG style of blogging. I just want to type some words, drag in an image or two, and hit a Publish button. I want comments without jumping through hoops. I want free analytics built-in. I want an ecosystem. I want to be able to change themes without spending hours doing complex find-and-replace operations to get my front matter correct.

Anyway, for now: ðŸ‘‰ **[Baty.blog](https://baty.blog)** is the place.

I like the default WordPress theme I'm using. Gutenberg isn't my favorite thing, but it's fine for the most part. I'm also playing with Dave Winer's [Wordland](https://wordland.social) tool for easily posting to a WordPress blog.

You'll notice that I'm not _replacing_ baty.net with WordPress. We all know that I'll likely be back here in a week, so I'm just saving myself some time in advance.

See you [there](https://baty.blog)! Oh, the RSS feed is <https://baty.blog/feed/>.
