Here are some (probably) unnecessary things I've been doing.

For posting to baty.net, I first create the post as a Markdown file in Emacs for the Hugo version of the blog. Which, as of today, I'm not even using. Then, I copy the rendered post from a browser and paste it into a new post in Ghost's control panel for publishing.

I tell myself that this is so I have a local, plain-text copy of my posts. While this is true, it's also so that I have a Hugo-ready copy of everything, for when I inevitably switch back to Hugo from Ghost.

Another case of duplication involves photos. I edit photos using Capture One, where I use "Sessions" rather than their catalogs. For my main catalog, I've been relying on Apple Photos. Whenever I finish editing photos, I export a copy to Photos. As a result, I have many photos—some, not all—stored in two places. I don't see a way around this duplication, as I prefer not to use Lightroom, and Capture One's cataloging features are lacking.

For personal journaling, I've used Org-journal in Emacs for years. However, there's nothing like Day One for dealing with photos, geolocation, and resurfacing past entries with the "On This Day" feature. Plus, mobile.

So I've continued using Org-journal, but at the end of each month, I [import the entries into Day One](/posts/2025/06/importing-org-journal-to-day-one/).

What else? Oh, right, speaking of journaling, I try to write in my paper notebooks every day. This is like meditation for me, and I adore having the handwritten artifacts. Except I'd like certain things to be easily searchable, so I rewrite(type) those entries into Org-journal. So yeah, now there's 3 versions of some stuff.

Anyway, I don't know if there's anything I want or need to do about all this, it's just something I noticed.
