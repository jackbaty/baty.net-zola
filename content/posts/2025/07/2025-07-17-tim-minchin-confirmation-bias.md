If he's a bit manic for you, here's part of the transcript that I've reformatted a bit:

<blockquote>
...if you're a progressive, don't do this. Don't go on to the internet and go, "Hey fellow progressives, like maybe we should consider having, you know, a little - just just chill out a bit and have a bit of humility and realise that not everyone's had the opportunity to read the books we've read and not everyone's, you know, learned the lessons that you've learned. Maybe we should apply the Principle of Charity and not assume that anyone who disagrees with us has a nefarious intent and try and hear the best version of the argument, not the worst. And maybe we just need to-" 


<br>They go, "Don't you police my tone, you straight white male! Check your privilege!" 

And I go, "Fuck, you're absolutely right. I'm sorry, I'll check my privilege." So I go and check my privilege, which I keep in my library on a mahogany shelf in between my BMW keys and a large Fortnum and Mason's tin of 50 dollar notes. And I come back and I say, "I checked my privilege and you're still fucking wrong." 

Because, because, because it cannot be okay. It can't. It cannot. It cannot be, can it? If , if the intention of progressives, which I assume it is, is to progress forward into a future of more empathy and understanding for more and more people, it cannot be, can it, that the primary mechanism by which we're going to make that progress is the suppression of empathy and understanding for anyone who doesn't align with our beliefs? It cannot be that unmitigated expression of furious outrage will somehow alchemize into a future of peace and love.

And of course there's something to be discussed about the justification - of course there's many, many reasons to be righteously furious. I'm a straight white cisgendered male and I could be furious about 700 things before any given breakfast. But it doesn't fucking matter if it's not helping, and it's not helping. The tribes are getting further and further apart. And then the point is, it's very hard to change people's minds - but we got there - but it is not impossible.

<strong>However, one thing is a hundred percent certain: if you tell someone that they're a fascist and publicly shame them on the Internet for what they believe, you've lost them.</strong> 

You have prioritised your need to express your outrage and, if we're honest, more often than not signal your virtue over the possibility that you could utilise your educational privilege to reach across this algorithmic chasm.
