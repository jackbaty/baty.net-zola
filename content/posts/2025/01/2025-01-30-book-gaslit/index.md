> An absolutely gripping psychological thriller packed with a twist you won't see coming

Do you know why I didn't see it coming? Because the narrator is not only unreliable, he's a liar. Also, things like, and I'm (barely) paraphrasing here, "Does she like me? I think she likes me!" What is he, 15? I was bored.

Rating: ★☆☆
