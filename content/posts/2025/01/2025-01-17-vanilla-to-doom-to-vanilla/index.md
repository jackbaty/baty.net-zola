I'd been happily using Doom Emacs until just over a month ago, when I decided toÂ [start from scratch again](https://baty.net/posts/2024/12/emacs-from-scratch-once-again).Â

It didn't take long before I started missing some of the niceties of Doom. I'm faster when using Doom/Evil, and sometimes it's good having things taken care of for me.

So, at the beginning of January, I switched back to Doom.

After a week using Doom, I was feeling pretty comfy. Too comfy, in fact. I couldn't shake the feeling that every Doom keybinding I internalized brought me closer toÂ _depending_Â on Doom. It made me twitchy. Every time I typed something likeÂ `SPC m a a`Â or put a Doom macro likeÂ `after!`Â orÂ `map!`Â in my configuration, I felt like I was spending time learningÂ _someone else's tool_.

So, this morning I switched back to my vanilla config.

Now I feel better. I'm a little clumsier, and sometimes I wish I didn't have to doÂ _everything_, but dammit it's MINE! ðŸ˜„.
