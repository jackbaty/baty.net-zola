[Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)Â is a new, platform-native terminal app fromÂ [Mitchell Hashimoto](https://mitchellh.com/). I've been alternating between Ghostty and Apple's Terminal for about a week.

I like Ghostty. It feels nice right out of the box. Configuration is done via a simple text file, but almost no configuration is necessary. Sensible defaults always make a good first impression, and Ghostty makes a really good first impression.

Most of the early reviews I've read begin with raves about how fast Ghostty is. Is it that fast, though? It's pretty fast, actually, but it's not noticeably faster on my Mac than Apple's Terminal. I keep comparing the two, and I find no meaningful difference in speed for anything I do with a terminal. It's not slower than Terminal, certainly, but I suspect that all this talk about speed is partially because we like new things and because everyone elseÂ _says_Â it's fast. We're an impressionable lot ðŸ˜€.

Either way, give me a nice, free, native-but-cross-platform terminal app with lots of nice features, while at the same time being at least as fast as anything else, and I'm in.

I recommend trying Ghostty. It's a damn fine terminal app.
