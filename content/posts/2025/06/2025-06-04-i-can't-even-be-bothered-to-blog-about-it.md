The past week has been weird for me, blog-wise. Normally, I fire up a daily post every morning because I _want_ to. I then keep my eyes peeled for interesting things to post about. I like posting stuff on the blog. Lately, though, I haven't felt like it.

Examples?

After many years of wanting a Rolleiflex, I bought one a couple weeks ago. I'm excited about it and I have thoughts about it, so why haven't I posted anything?

I've started using Howm (rather than Denote) for most of my notes. This is big, right? Yet as far as blogging about it? Crickets.

I don't know what's wrong with me, but I just don't feel like doing the work. This would be fine if I was doing something else instead. But I'm not. Instead of writing, I'm _not_ writing, is all.

Anyway, I'm sure this is just a phase. At least I hope that's all it is. For once I'm not changing platforms again as an excuse to post something, so that's good, I guess.
