Baty.net is going to move back to Ghost, I think. Y'all will I'm sure get a chuckle out of it and I'm happy for you. :)

I've noticed that when running both Ghost and Hugo blogs, when I want to post something, my default is to reach for Ghost. It's just easier overall. Plus, I can have that sweet, sweet @jack@baty.net Fediverse handle that I loved but didn't want tied to my blogging platform.

And to think, just two days ago I added a bunch of new features to the Hugo theme.

This is fine.
