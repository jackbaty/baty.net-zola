Linus Torvalds (Mastodon):

> I'm a card-carrying atheist, I think a woman's right to choose is very important, I think that "well regulated militia" means that guns should be carefully licensed and not just randomly given to any moron with a pulse, and I couldn't care less if you decided to dress up in the "wrong" clothes or decided you'd rather live your life without feeling tied to whatever plumbing you were born with.
And dammit, if that all makes me "woke", then I think anybody who uses that word as a pejorative is a f*cking disgrace to the human race.
