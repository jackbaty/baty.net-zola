I got big into [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com) around 2018, when I created my [Rudimentary Lathe wiki](https://wiki.baty.net). For a few years there, I put stuff into it daily. I sometimes drift away to something New/Shiny, but I always end up back in TiddlyWiki.

Off the top of my head, here are a few things I like about TiddlyWiki:

<!--more-->

- My entire wiki is just a single HTML file. That's it. Open it in any browser and you have the whole thing[^1].
- Tiddlers (aka Notes) can be copied between wikis by simple drag and drop.
- Hosting a read-only version of the wiki is easy as copying the file to a web server somewhere.
- I don't get fancy, but I _could_. TiddlyWiki is a kind of [Quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)), giving it nearly Emacs-level customization options.
- Making new notes is so easy. I don't need to worry about files or names or none of that. Hit the button, type, and save.
- Using TiddlyWiki is different than using anything else. I like that about it. Feels like zagging.
- It's like the old web where everything one does with it is visible. It's easy to adopt someone else's clever ideas.

I'm sure there are more, but that's a good start.

There aren't many downsides. The room's elephant is that, since it's just an HTML file, it can be difficult to get things set up so you can save changes easily. I use a WebDAV server. Before that, I used the [Timimi plugin](https://ibnishak.github.io/Timimi/).

Every time I visit [my wiki](https://wiki.baty.net), it reveals something interesting from my past. I don't know how or why I would continue to ignore that.

[^1]: Technically, that's a lie. I use external images, but you know what I mean.
