I've decided to exclude "Journal" posts from the RSS feed. Thing is, I like how it feels to write stuff here knowing that it's not "going anywhere". If something shows up that is particularly brilliant, I'll create a separate post. Since most things are decidedly _not_ particularly brilliant, I'll feel better keeping it to myself (and the handful of ~~loonies~~ people who actually come and visit the website).

If there's an outcry, I'll put things back. Or maybe set up a separate feed just for the journal entries. I dunno.

**UPDATE**: OK, I did get a couple of emails asking for journal posts in the RSS feed. As a compromise, I've added a feed for just the journal posts: https://baty.net/journal/index.xml. It's a bit less convenient this way, but seems fair.
