I've spent a lot of time over the past couple years forcing various blogging platforms to behave the way I want them to. That is: Daily notes grouped by day, with stand-along posts scattered between.

With this new blog and Hugo theme, I've forced myself to leave things alone (other than some CSS tweaks). It's a relief.

Everything is a Post, here.

If I want to publish something, it's a new post. I don't get to (or _have_ to) decide where it fits. It's a Post. Short or long...it's a Post.

It's kind of liberating. I'll tire of it, but for now I'm enjoying the constraint.
