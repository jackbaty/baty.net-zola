I wasn't planning to put journal posts here. I don't like how they fill up the archives with a list of dates. Yet, here I am.

The news and my feeds have become a stream of terrible things. I don't know how to stop it, or how to help, or even how to survive it all. I feel helpless.

As much as I like how Kirby manages baty.net, I still can't get confortable not having a fully static website. I know it doesn't actually matter. Millions of blogs run on WordPress, Ghost, whatever. It's fine, but it bothers me and that low-grade annoyance takes a toll. That's probably why I'm here in Hugo again today.

I'm planning to leverage Flickr a bit more when posting to social media. My Mastodon posts aren't forever, so relying on a 3rd-party image hosting service is no big deal. Plus, I've been using Flickr since 2004, so I'm counting on Mr. Lindy[^1].

[^1]: There is no Mr. Lindy, but that's what I'm calling the [Lindy Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect) here :).
