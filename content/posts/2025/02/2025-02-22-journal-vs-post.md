Currently, my blog has two types of posts, Journal and Post. Journal entries are comprised of things I collect or think about during each day. I post one per day. Posts are your typical blog post. Posts are (usually) a bit longer and are about a single topic.

I'd like to eliminate the Journal posts, but have not found a way to do that. I could post every random thing that occurs to me as a full Post, but that feels too noisy and weird. I could move the Journal posts to [the wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.org). I still do that, sometimes. Or, I could stop writing them. Only the first two options are feasible, so which is it? I don't know.

For now, I'd like to move more of the Journal notes into their own Posts, and leave the journal for truly unstructured bits and bobs. It would be noise, mostly.

Still noodlin' on it.
