Heh, [Dave noticed](https://nice-marmot.net/Archives/2025/February_2025.html#note_2752) that I [bought a new camera](https://baty.net/posts/2025/02/the-nikon-zf/) and now he's thinking about new cameras.

A friend of mine told me once that whenever I mentioned wanting something three times, he knew that I'd end up buying it. It's true. I've been circling the Zf for months. Another friend recently bought a Z8 and nice lenses (that I could borrow), and the FM2n has been growing on my. Nikon has been on my mind, and the only one I find interesting is the Zf.

My <dfn><abbr title="Gear Acquisition Syndrome">GAS</abbr></dfn> usually flares up when I'm feeling bored or frustrated with photography. It happens a lot. This time it started with wanting to replace the SL2 with an M10-P. The M10-P still sells for around $5,000, so I was looking for something interesting, but less expensive. The Nikon fit the bill.

I hope Dave finds his version of it.
