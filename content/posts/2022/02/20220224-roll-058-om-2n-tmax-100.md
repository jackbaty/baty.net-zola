I ran a roll of TMAX-100 through the Olympus OM-2n. As always, I had the lovely 85mm Zuiko attached. This time, I also strapped on the flash.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

It was not a successful roll. Maybe three images were salvageable. Why did it have to be shots like this?<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

Or this one of Charlie, which was typically mis-focused. I may need to try a new focusing screen.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">
