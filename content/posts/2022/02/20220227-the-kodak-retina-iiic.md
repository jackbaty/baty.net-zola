My dad called me from Florida and said that one of his neighbors had died and left a bunch of camera stuff to be given away or sold. He mentioned there was &#8220;some old Kodak&#8221; and wondered if I was interested in it. I said &#8220;Sure, why not&#8221; and he said he&#8217;d send me a box with the camera and some other stuff that came in the box.

The box arrived yesterday and I was thrilled to find a working Kodak Retina IIIC inside. I didn&#8217;t know much about the Retinas except they were around for many years and were very high quality cameras, which isn&#8217;t something Kodak is known for.

The last of the Retinas, the &#8220;Big-C&#8221; IIIC was made from 1957-1960. I assume that mine was made somewhere late in that range, based on the serial number. It doesn&#8217;t have the absolute latest changes, so let&#8217;s guess 1959.

I was surprised by how nicely the camera is built. It&#8217;s dense and feels very solid. All the movements, from focusing to folding the lens, are smooth and dampened well. It&#8217;s not quite Leica-level build, but much closer to it than I expected, especially considering the price.

I put a roll through it immediately and everything appears to work perfectly. Not bad for a 60-plus-year-old camera. Here are a few snaps taken around the house from that test roll.

One of the lauded features of the IIIC is the 50mm f/2 Schneider-Kreuznach Retina-Xenon lens. I haven&#8217;t shot enough to get a good feel, but even after one quick roll I can see that it&#8217;s no slouch.

For more details about the camera, there are a few good resources. I enjoyed this [Retina IIIC review by Kurt Munger][8]. For everything you need to know, Chris Sherlock has a [ton of info on the Retina series][9].

I don&#8217;t know yet how often I&#8217;ll use this new camera, but it&#8217;s certainly not going to spend the rest of its days on a shelf.

Here&#8217;s the [camera&#8217;s page on my wiki][10]
