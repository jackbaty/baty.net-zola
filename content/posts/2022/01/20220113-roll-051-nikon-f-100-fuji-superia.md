I discovered, while rummaging through a drawer, that my Nikon F-100 was loaded with film; Fujifilm Superia, a color film. I&#8217;ve pretty much sworn off color, but what the hell, I threw a little Godox flash on the F-100 and burned through the rest of the roll. I still had some C-41 chemistry mixed, but it was well past its prime.

As is often the case with color film, it was a bust. For some reason the Flash, while it seemed to be firing, left most frames wildly under-exposed. There&#8217;s no getting away with underexposing color film. The results were mostly horrible. Oh well. It was fun to use the Nikon again.<figure class="wp-container-8 wp-block-gallery-624ad30832da4 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large">
