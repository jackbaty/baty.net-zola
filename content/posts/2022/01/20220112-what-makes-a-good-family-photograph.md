The above photo is a good family photograph. Why? Because it doesn&#8217;t just capture members of the family, it captures a family _moment_. So many family photos are smiling selfies taken at arm&#8217;s length. Selfies say, &#8220;Here these people are.&#8221; but not much more. They&#8217;re fine, but ultimately not much more than basic record-keeping. I much prefer photos showing family simply living and interacting in their natural habitat. Here&#8217;s another from the same roll:<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized">

These were both taken with a film camera in low light, so required a slow shutter speed and wide aperture. This meant missed focus and some motion blur. I don&#8217;t care. It&#8217;s the moment that counts, not the sharpness. And being film photos, it means I&#8217;ll forever have the original negatives on my shelf. Of course that doesn&#8217;t make the photo better, but it does make me feel good.
