A few folks[1](https://rudimentarylathe.org/#b4f25d54-0f78-4548-b8d3-ad77b2d53d84) have been posting about their current subscriptions. Here is a list of my subscriptions, in alphabetical order, because I didn’t want to try categorizing them.

*   **1Password**: $5 – Apple’s password manager needs to improve a lot before I’ll consider replacing this
*   **Adobe**: $10 – I’m trying the Lightroom 1TB plan. Seeing if I can live with just Lightroom Desktop.
*   **Amazon AWS**: $2 – I don’t even know where this charge is coming from
*   **Amazon Prime**: $9 – Indispensable
*   **Apple One: $37** – I really only want Music, TV+, and 2TB of iCloud storage but they make it impossible to cherry-pick
*   **Capture One**: $15 – Raw photo editing. I keep trying to replace this with Adobe but can’t
*   **Day One**: $2 – On-and-off journaling app for over a decade. I’m currently On again.
*   **DigitalOcean**: $15 – My VPS
*   **Fastmail**: $5 – Great email service
*   **Flickr**: $6 – It’s sad to see the world slowly stop using Flickr. I’ve got thousands of photos over nearly 20 years stored there. No way I can quit now.
*   **Glass**: $3 – Modern social photo sharing. Glass is really nice and it’s all about the photos (as opposed to, say, Instagram)
*   **Hulu**: $12 – I’m surprised by how much stuff I watch on Hulu
*   **Max (HBO)**: $18 – This can probably go
*   **Neatnik (omg.lol)**: $2 – My Mastodon account. Also a ton of other nice services.
*   **Netflix**: $17 – This may go soon, too.
*   **NYTimes**: $25 – Paper of record, whether we like it or not.
*   **Photomator**: $3 – The only way I can deal with editing iPhone photos
*   **Photoscan**: $4 – If I ever get around to scanning my grandfathers 24 photo albums, I’ll need this
*   **Put.io**: $10 – Such a handy service for managing torrents
*   **Qobuz**: $11 – Music. It works seamlessly with Roon so I kind of need it.
*   **SetApp**: $10 – Like Netflix for apps. I use a dozen of them nearly every day. Easily worth the $10/month.
*   **Sourcehut**: $2 – Now that I’m using my own Gitea instance again, this can probably go.
*   **Spotify**: $15 – My kids prefer this to Apple Music. I may put my foot down and make them switch.
*   **The Atlantic**: $6 – A favorite
*   **Tinylitics**: $5 – A new, nice, privacy-focused analytics platform.
*   **YouTube Premium**: $18 – Don’t tell Google, but not seeing ads on YouTube is worth double this to me.

For a total of **$256 per month**. That seems like a lot, but I have another list of _canceled_ subscriptions totaling around $125 so I'm improving!
