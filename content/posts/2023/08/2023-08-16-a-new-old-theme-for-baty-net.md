summary: I needed a change, so I brought the Papermod theme back.
---

Sometimes I just need to change things up in order to renew my interest. This blog has been languishing lately, so I decided to change themes again to see if that helped. Rather than deal with implementing a completely new theme, I instead rolled back to [hugo-PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod).

There is a bit of CSS work to do, and I'm missing a couple of nice shortcodes from Congo, but overall it's a pleasant change.
