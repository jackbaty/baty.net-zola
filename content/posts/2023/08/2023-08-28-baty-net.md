summary: What's the deal with Baty.net?
---

So I've been thinking about what to do with baty.net. After firing up my old-school looking WordPress blog at [rudimentarylathe.org](https://rudimentarylathe.org), I kind of want to move away from static blogging for a while. But I don't want to migrate the content here at baty.net.

What I think I'd like is to use baty.net as a launchpad and storage bin for everything. The home page becomes a set of links to everything else. But also, since it would be completely static and not rendered by Hugo or anything, I could just toss anything here and link to it however I like. That seems fun, right?

As a first step, I've changed the PaperMod theme to "Profile" mode, so the home page only shows my avatar and a few links. Later, I'll disconnect it from Hugo and build my own home page. I'll leave all the rendered archives where they are.

This is the plan anyway. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. It's possible the novelty of using WordPress will wear thin before anything drastic happens and I'll just write a big ol' "Never Mind" post and be done with it.
