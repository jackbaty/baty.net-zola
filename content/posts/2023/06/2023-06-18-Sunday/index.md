![Alice](alice.jpg "Alice")


This photo of Alice (above) is from a roll of HP5 that I put through the the Hasselblad (500C/M) yesterday. The Hasselblad V series are my favorite cameras alongside the Leica M. Medium format film renders in a way that 35mm doesn't. And the Zeiss lenses are so good. I wish I used it more often. Maybe I will.
