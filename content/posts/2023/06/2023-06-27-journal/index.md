summary: Why I don't quit Emacs. A new (2014) Mac Mini
---


I think I've figured out why I never seem to stop using Emacs. It's because Emacs _resonates_ with me in a way that no other tool has.

Can we stop saying, "This is The Way" now? If not, in retaliation I'm bringing back Mork's "Nanu Nanu".

Thanks to a [post from Brett Terpstra](https://nojack.easydns.ca/@ttscoff/110617655777277597), I've gone and ordered a 2014 Mac Mini (16GB/1TB) for $100 cleaned, tested, bootable, and shipped from [Orchard Resales](https://orchardresales.com/products/mac-mini-2014?variant=44931692724538). The intent is to perhaps replace my overwrought Synology setup. Or maybe I'll just set it up separately for other "stuff".
