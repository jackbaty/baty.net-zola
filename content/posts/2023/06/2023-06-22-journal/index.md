I've stopped using ox-hugo for writing posts and started [Editing Hugo's markdown files directly](/2023/editing-hugos-markdown-directly/)

Another change to the blog is that I'm no longer assigning "featured" images to posts. The Congo theme does a great job of handling them, but I don't like feeling like I _have_ to include a featured image with every single post, and I don't like how the home page renders when some posts have them and some don't.
