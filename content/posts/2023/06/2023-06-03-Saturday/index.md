## Today {#today}

I'm still working through what goes into daily notes vs separate blog posts. My old rule was that anything longer than a short paragraph got its own post. Now, though, I think I prefer keeping things in the daily posts unless they _need_ their own post. All that's left is to define what I mean by "need".
