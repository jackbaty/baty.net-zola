People are claiming it would be stupid and foolish to meet with Meta about their Fediverse plans and sign an NDA. I dunno. I might rather _know_ something and not be able to share it than not know the thing in the first place. Besides, it's almost always better to talk with someone, even your enemy, than not.

David Foster Wallace, on tourism: 

> To be a mass tourist, for me, is to become a pure late-date American: alien, ignorant, greedy for something you cannot ever have, disappointed in a way you can never admit. It is to spoil, by way of sheer ontology, the very unspoiledness you are there to experience. It is to impose yourself on places that in all noneconomic ways would be better, realer, without you. It is, in lines and gridlock and transaction after transaction, to confront a dimension of yourself that is as inescapable as it is painful: As a tourist, you become economically significant but existentially loathsome, an insect on a dead thing.

I'm increasingly weary of complexity in any form. I can't decide where Emacs lands on the complexity scale.
