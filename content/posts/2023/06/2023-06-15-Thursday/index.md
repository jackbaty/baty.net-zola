I need a reset. A re-calibration of some sort. I have been spinning my wheels for months, with little to show for it. I want a job, but haven't been putting the necessary pieces into place. I spend my days changing my process, my software, my priorities, and my plans. I'm thinking about all the wrong things. I need to find a way to stabilize all this.

Most of the time, Emacs feels like a superpower. Other times, though, it can feel like a gigantic waste of time and energy.

Normal Person: "Is there a better way to do the things I need to do?"

Me: "I should create a complex, overwrought process using every tool at my disposal just in case one day I need to do something with it."
