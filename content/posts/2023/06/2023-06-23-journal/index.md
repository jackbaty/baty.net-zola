summary: Wasting time in Emacs. Essential Knowledge book bundle.
coverCaption: "Breakfast (from Crumbl Cookies)"

I spent (and by "spent" I mean "wasted") an hour and a half this morning trying to get my custom delete command mapped to the "D" key in notmuch. Reading that sentence only reinforces the fact that I've once again lost a good portion of a day on something that would be a non-issue in anything other than Emacs. My key binding still doesn't work. I've given up. Next!

I just paid $25 for 24 ePub books in the [Essential Knowledge book bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/essential-knowledge-mit-press-books). I'll start, ironically, with "[Analog](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262544498/analog/)" from Robert Hassan. The bundle seems like a good deal to me.

Of course it was a tragedy, but they weren't "explorers". They were tourists.
