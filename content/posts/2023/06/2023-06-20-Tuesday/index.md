There was something about the PaperMod theme I was using here that didn't sit right with me. It's a nice theme, but _off_ somehow. So I've gone back to [Congo](https://git.io/hugo-congo). I have some issues with Congo, too, but it's well-supported and being actively developed, so I'm hopeful I can sort it out.

What am I going to do with this thing?
