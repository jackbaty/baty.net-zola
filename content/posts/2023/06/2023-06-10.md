I lost my head for a second and thought maybe I'd do the whole "Emacs from scratch" thing again. This time, I tried the new beta branch of [Crafted Emacs](https://github.com/SystemCrafters/crafted-emacs) because I like their approach on the new version. But yeah, it's beta and things broke and I'm not good enough to troubleshoot. Back to Doom for now.
