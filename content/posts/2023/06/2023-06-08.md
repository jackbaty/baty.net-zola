I started reading the [MPU forums](https://talk.macpowerusers.com/latest) this morning and was immediately reminded that I should never read the MPU forums. I do plenty of navel gazing around note-taking and software workflows and everything else already. I don't need more of it, thank you.

Day 2 running Sonoma on my MBP. I've not noticed any significant issues so far. Maestral crashed a couple of times at first, but seems to have settled down.
