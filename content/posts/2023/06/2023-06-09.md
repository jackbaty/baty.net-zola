I understand why people are upset about Reddit's API changes. People are _always_ upset about something Reddit is doing. And I feel for Apollo's developer. The whole thing sucks. I've never used Apollo. I go to the website and visit a few of my favorite subreddits every once in a while. I just don't feel any outrage about the whole thing, sorry. I am attributing this to my recent withdrawal from social media. I guess since no one has been telling me to be upset, I'm not.

Some days I fully enjoy managing email within Mu4e. Other days, I hate it. Today is the former.
