A thing I'm trying: [Forming some kind of Rudimentary Lathe](https://rudimentarylathe.org/2023/forming-some-sort-of-rudimentary-lathe/)

[MWeb](https://www.mweb.im/index.html) is a "Markdown writing, note taking and static blog generator" for macOS and iOS. I played with it briefly, since I'm on another of my "wean yourself from Emacs" kicks. It's nice. The site generator looks pretty good. I'd say if you're a folder-full-of-markdown-files person, MWeb is worth a look.

Whenever I decide to edit a file in something "nicer" than Emacs, I start out feeling relieved. Then, ten minutes later, I'm so annoyed that I crawl back into Emacs.
