I've been having thoughts of more Linux. I've got MINT running on the little MacBook Air, but also glanced at the ThinkPad Carbon running Pop\_OS that's sitting on a shelf. It would be fun to play with, but then I remembered that the most productive move I've ever made was to stick with running one OS on one computer. Some day that may be Pop\_OS on a Thinkpad, but right now it's macOS on a MacBook Pro.
