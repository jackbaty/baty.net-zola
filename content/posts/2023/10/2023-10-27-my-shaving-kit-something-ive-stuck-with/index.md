People make fun of me for frequently changing the way I do things. This is not undeserved. I like to try things. That's me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

But as a counterpoint, sometimes I stick with things for a long time. Today's example is shaving. I was so annoyed by the price of disposable blades for my razor that I started shopping for alternatives. 

What I found was safety razors, nice shaving cream, and a brush. I use a [Merkur safety razor](https://merkurshave.com/merkur-safety-razor-34c-straight-guard-german-9034001/), [Vulfix brush](https://www.diamondedgeltd.com/progress-vulfix-mayfair-403-shaving-brush-c2x20731684 ) (Warning[^brush]), [Taylor of Old Bond Street Almond shaving cream](https://www.tayloroldbondst.co.uk/collections/shaving-creams/products/almond-shaving-cream-bowl-150g), and [Shark double edge razor blades](https://www.amazon.com/Shark-Double-Blades-Stainless-blades/dp/B004RWZ1RE). I've been using this exact setup since 2005.

It costs a little extra up front, but everything after that is better, including costs. And no overpriced, plasticy blades. The last time I bought blades was in 2018 and I paid $8.00 for 100 blades. I have many left. It costs much less than $1.00/month for blades. And a jar of shaving cream lasts for many months. 

Aside from saving money, using the kit simply feels better. I don't anticipate any of this changing, which is a nice...er...change of pace for me.

[^brush]: Note that brushes using badger fur are made from, well, real badgers. Those badgers are sometimes badly mistreated. I didn't know that at the time I bought mine. Today, I would recommend a synthetic brush instead.
