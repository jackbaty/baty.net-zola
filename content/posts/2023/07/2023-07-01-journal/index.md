summary: Bombs with blinking lights. Obsidian? Harvard. Bluesky.
---

It bugs me when someone in a movie plants a bomb or listening device and there's always a light on it somewhere that _blinks_. I was watching an episode of "The Blacklist" and when they inserted a tracker in Reddington's neck it was blinking. Blinking! Do they really believe that we viewers are so stupid that we need to be reminded that "Hey! It's a device!"? Apparently so. Maybe there's some real-world reason that I'm not aware of, but I can't think of what that might be.

I hate to admit it, but Obsidian makes a lot of things really easy that would take me much longer in Emacs.

I'm having feelings about my notes being full of `denote:NNNN`-style links. It worries me.

If you were in a position to get your kid into Harvard, you would do it. I get a kick out of people who claim otherwise.

Hey anyone want a Bluesky invite it's a new site where everyone is just trying so very hard to out-clever each other while smugly poking fun of other social networks.
