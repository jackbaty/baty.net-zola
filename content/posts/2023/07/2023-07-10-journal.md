summary: Being nice. The Little Mermaid and my daughter.
---

I want to be nice but I don't always feel like I'm nice.

My daughter and I must have watched "The Little Mermaid" 1,000 times while she was young. Today, we went to see the new live-action version at the theater. She was actually giddy at times. Just before the part where Ariel is on the rock and sings "Part of your world!" while the waves kick up beind her, Jess was tapping my arm saying, "It's happening, it's happening!" and bouncing in her seat and clapping her hands together, grinning. She's 34. It was wonderful.
