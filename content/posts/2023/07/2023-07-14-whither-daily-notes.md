I don't know if you noticed, but I've been posting my Daily Notes over on [daily.baty.net](https://daily.baty.net/) again for some reason. I tell myself the reason is that I don't like how this blog feels/looks when the entire site becomes not much more than a list of dates.

Scanning the [Archives](/archives/) should be useful. Currently, it's not. And search suffers, too. I've been around this block so many times I've worn a path. 

If I'm being honest, I think the real reason is that I missed using [Tinderbox](https://eastgate.com/Tinderbox) and I missed the way that daily.baty.net works.

I know that some people who read this blog have told me they prefer that I keep everything here rather than them being forced to chase me all over the internet. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

If you're interested, the daily post summary RSS feed is https://daily.baty.net/index.xml and the feed for each individual post is https://daily.baty.net/allposts.xml.

(But keep this site's feed handy because who knows what'll happen)
