summary: Links should looks like link. Let's bring back blue and purple.

I still resent that at some point capital-D “Design” trumped usability on web pages. The most egregious example is link colors. Blue and purple links were deemed too “ugly” and were replaced by barely distinguishable variants. This blog’s theme, for example, removes colors from links by default. I’ve fixed that. It’s not as pretty, but at least you can easily tell where the links are (and which ones have been :visited).

Ok, technically I didn’t change every link. Only the ones within the posts. Otherwise, nearly everything would be blue and purple and even I can’t abide that much visual clutter.

You’re welcome.
