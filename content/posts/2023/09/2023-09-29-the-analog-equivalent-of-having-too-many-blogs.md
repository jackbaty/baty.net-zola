![The notebooks I’m actively using right now. Seriously.](/img/2023/09/20230929-notebooks.jpg "The notebooks I’m actively using right now. Seriously.")

We all know that I have too many blogs. What’s less obvious is that I use too many different notebooks. Here’s what’s currently in rotation:

1.  A yellow legal pad. It’s nice to just throw stuff on the top page without thinking.
2.  [Leuchtturm 1917 A5 Notebook (lined)](https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/notebook-classic.html). This is my sort-of bullet journal. I keep lists and notes here, mostly.
3.  [Hobonichi Techo](https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2024/all_about/planner/). This is my calendar/planner. I keep appointments and important dates here. I also try to jot down a quick summary of the day or a small drawing representing something that happened.
4.  [Field Notes “Dime Novel” edition](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/products/dimenovel). I recently found this on a shelf and thought it too pretty to ignore. This is likely to become my next journal, even though I’ve cheated and started writing in it already.
5.  [Midori MD Notebook](https://md.midori-japan.co.jp/en/products/mdnote/) (lined). This is only for journaling. I like the paper and the 7mm lines.
6.  Index cards. I can’t decide what goes on index cards, but I keep them everywhere, just in case. Usually, I write quotes on them so I can pin them to my bulletin board. I also have maintained a half-assed Zettelkasten on the cards, but that’s mostly died on the vine.

Is this too many? I don’t know. Some days it feels like a huge mess and I worry that I’m writing something in the “wrong” place. Other days, it’s perfect and I like having the options.

So, a lot like blogging, then :).
